# 9.66-final-project
final project for computational cognitive science, team members: Krithik, Maxi, Reina. 

Please start with CLUTRR code as it has full working examples


## Overview

In this repository you will find code for the execution of the adapted PLoT with GPT for the Cluttr, Babi, E-share, and HOTPot QA. All code used in Final Project, Experimentation, and figures from the project were developed by Krithik Ramesh.


## Datasets in this repository: 

In this repository you will find the csv fiels for the cluttr data, the text files for the Babi dataset (downloaded from the keras utils and processed), and the E-share dataset. the HotPot QA dataset was loaded from the hugging face dataset module. 


## Running and Replicating experiments: 

The OpenAI environemnt keys have been removed for security reasons, but replacing them with you own key will let you execute any code by simplifiying the python and specifying the appropriate csv file. There is a possibility that the executing GPT scripts might not work unless computer permission is granted to run subprocesses from python, I personally had a few issues with this execution and had to use sudo commands and change security privleges briefly.
