# 9.66-final-project
final project for computational cognitive science, team members: Krithik, Maxi, Reina


#Overview

In this repository you will find code for the execution of the adapted PLoT with GPT for the Cluttr, Babi, E-share, and HOTPot QA 


#Datasets in this repository: 

In this repository you will find the csv fiels for the cluttr data, the text files for the Babi dataset (downloaded from the keras utils and processed), and the E-share dataset. the HotPot QA dataset was loaded from the hugging face dataset module. 


#Running and Replicating experiments: 

The OpenAI environemnt keys have been removed for security reasons, but replacing them with you own key will let you execute any code by simplifiying the python and specifying the appropriate csv file.
