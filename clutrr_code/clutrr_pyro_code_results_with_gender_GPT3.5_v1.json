The `infer_relationship` function performs inference by running the model multiple times and counting the occurrences of each relationship. The most likely relationship is returned as the answer to the query.\n\nTo ensure that the correct answer has the highest probability, we give positive adjustments to the probabilities for the relationships we believe to be true.
