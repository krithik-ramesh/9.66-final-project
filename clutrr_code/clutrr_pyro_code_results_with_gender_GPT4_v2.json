We then define a Pyro model that samples a relationship according to these probabilities, and an inference function that estimates the most likely relationship based on multiple samples. Finally, we run the inference function for our query (\"Michael\", \"Eric\") and print the most likely relationship. As specified, this relationship would be 'father-in-law'."
