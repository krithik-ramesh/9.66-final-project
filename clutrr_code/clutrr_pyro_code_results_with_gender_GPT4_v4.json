Hence, we increase 'mother-in-law' probability for the pair ('John', 'Theresa')."

She just wanted to know how [Karen] was doing. \n\nWith genders of Shirley:female, Constance:female, Karen:female, Vernon:male, and the query: ('Shirley', 'Karen'). And the possible relationships are mother-daughter, grandmother-granddaughter, so on and we already know from the story that Karen is Constance's grandma, and Shirley Constance's mom. Therefore, the relationship between Shirley and Karen is most likely mother-daughter where Shirley is the daughter.\n\nHere's the Pyro code:\n```\nimport torch\nimport pyro\nimport pyro.distributions as dist\n\ncharacters = {'Shirley': 'female', 'Constance': 'female', 'Karen': 'female', 'Vernon': 'male'}\nquery = ('Shirley', 'Karen')\nrelationships = ['mother', 'daughter', 'grandmother', 'granddaughter', 'sister', 'aunt', \n                 'cousin', 'son-in-law','daughter-in-law', 'mother-in-law', 'father-in-law',\n                 'aunt-in-law', 'cousin-in-law','brother-in-law', 'sister-in-law']\n\ndef adjust_probs_for_story(characters, query):\n    # Initialize probabilities\n    rel_probs = torch.ones(len(relationships)) / len(relationships)\n  \n    # Adjustments based on the story and query\n    if query == ('Shirley', 'Karen'):\n        # Shirley is the daughter of Karen \n        rel_probs[relationships.index('daughter')] += 0.9 # highest adjusted for correct relationship\n  \n    # Normalize probabilities\n    rel_probs /= rel_probs.sum()\n\n    return rel_probs, relationships\n\ndef model(characters, query):\n    rel_probs, relationships = adjust_probs_for_story(characters, query)\n    rel = pyro.sample(\"relationship\", dist.Categorical(probs=rel_probs))\n    return relationships[rel.item()]\n\ndef infer_relationship(characters, query):\n    inferred_relationships = [model(characters, query) for _ in range(1000)]\n    relationship_counts = {rel: inferred_relationships.count(rel) for rel in set(inferred_relationships)}\n    most_likely_relationship = max(relationship_counts, key=relationship_counts.get)\n    return most_likely_relationship\n\nmost_likely_relationship = infer_relationship(characters, query)\nprint(f\"The most likely relationship between {query[0]} and {query[1]} is: {most_likely_relationship}\")\n```\nSo, in the code above, I initialized probabilities for all the relationships equally. The adjustment of probabilities based on the story and query is done in the 'adjust_probs_for_story' function. I used the explicit information from the story to adjust probabilities and made sure to not subtract any probabilities since all the adjustments need to be positive. The code will return the relationship with the highest probability after the adjustments."
